This repository contains three simple Python scripts:

1. Calculator (task2.py): A command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The user inputs two numbers and the operation, and the result is displayed.

2. Password Generator (task3.py): A password generator that allows the user to specify the length of the password. It generates a random password from uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
  
3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (task4.py): A command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game keeps track of scores and continues for multiple rounds until the user decides to stop.
